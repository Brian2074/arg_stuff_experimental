# Copilot Instructions

This file provides repository-specific guidance for GitHub Copilot usage.

## Purpose
- Assist with code completion, tests, docs, and small refactors.
- Prefer suggestions that follow existing project patterns and style.

## Usage Guidelines
- Accept suggestions when they match project style and pass tests.
- Edit suggestions to match naming, formatting, and security practices.
- Do not accept suggestions that introduce secrets, hard-coded credentials, or unsafe patterns.

## Examples
- Use Copilot to generate function skeletons, unit tests, or README snippets.
- Review and run all generated code locally before merging.

## Configuration
- See .github/copilot.yml (if present) for repository-specific settings.
